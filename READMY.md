# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a platform that allows users to submit and manage requests, view and edit them, as well as track statistics related to these requests. 
The application serves as a centralized hub for processing user requests and tracking their progress, providing a streamlined and organized approach to managing user interactions.
In this project, I utilized various technologies to implement a backend server that provides a RESTful API for processing user requests. 
The technologies used include Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL for database management. Additionally, I used Postman for testing.
The frontend of the project was implemented using React and can be accessed at: [Frontend GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shyrshov-Olexandr/shyrshovfinalfront)
